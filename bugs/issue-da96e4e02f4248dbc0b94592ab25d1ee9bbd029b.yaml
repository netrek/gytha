    - added manual resolution support command line options
    - changed to fullscreen by default
    - make multiple attempts to change display resolution
    - accept a bad situation with grace rather than die
    - realign several screen objects to fit at least 1024x768
    - make alignment of objects dependent on resolution
    - tested on 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200
