title: tactical, hide cloaked ships
desc: |-
  currently cloaked ships are shown with a modified sprite for testing,
  and the position is next to useless because of the coordinate randomisation
  by the server (good).  need to remove them fully from tactical display,
  yet show them on galactic.
  
  might benefit from showing a large misty cloud on tactical, if we can afford
  the render time.

  - one alternative is to add more black space randomly to ship-cloak.png
