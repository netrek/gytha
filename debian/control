Description: Netrek Game Client
 This is a client for the multi-player game of Netrek, implemented in
 Python and Pygame.
 .
 Netrek is the probably the first video game which can accurately be
 described as a "sport."  It has more in common with basketball than
 with arcade games or Quake.  Its vast and expanding array of tactics
 and strategies allows for many different play styles; the best
 players are the ones who think fastest, not necessarily the ones who
 twitch most effectively.  It can be enjoyed as a twitch game, since
 the dogfighting system is extremely robust, but the things that
 really set Netrek apart from other video games are the team and
 strategic aspects.  Team play is dynamic and varied, with roles
 constantly changing as the game state changes.  Strategic play is
 explored in organized league games; after 6+ years of league play,
 strategies are still being invented and refined.
 .
 The game itself has existed for over 15 years, and has a solid
 playerbase, including some people who have been playing for nearly as
 long as the game has existed.
 .
 All Netrek clients and servers are completely free of charge,
 although there are several people working on commercial netrek
 variants or derivatives.
 .
 To start the client program, run /usr/bin/netrek-client-pygame, and a
 list of servers should be displayed.
